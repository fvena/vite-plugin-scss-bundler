## 💡 Motivation

Write one or two paragraphs describing the purpose of your library and what motivated you to develop it.

What problem does this library solve? Why is it better than existing alternatives?

## 🌟 Demo-Preview

Add a demo of your library.

> After introducing your project, it’s a good idea to include a demo or preview (video/gif/screenshots) of what your library does, so users know what to expect.

> I use [terminalizer](https://github.com/faressoft/terminalizer) for terminal recordings, and there are many free tools for screen recording and editing.

## 🚀Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Indicate if your library requires any prerequisites before it can be used, such as other libraries or a specific npm version:

```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```

### Installation

Step-by-step guide explaining how to download and install the library in the user's project.

```sh
npm install <library>
```

> Once development is complete and the library is published, I recommend following the steps yourself from scratch to ensure the workflow is correct.

## 🛠️ Usage

Explain how to use and configure your library so that users can implement it in their projects.

> If your library has many options or extensive functionality, it’s better to explain the basics here and provide a more comprehensive documentation elsewhere.

Refer to the documentation for more examples.

### Scripts Overview

| Script  | Description         |
| ------- | ------------------- |
| `build` | Builds the library. |
| `test`  | Runs the tests.     |

## 🗺️ Roadmap

When starting a project, we often aim for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) as quickly as possible, but there are always ideas left for later or parts that need refactoring for better performance.

Having a public roadmap for your project is always a good idea. It lets you pick up where you left off after a break and gives users confidence in an actively maintained library.

Additionally, users who know your development plans can suggest changes, ideas, or collaborations.

Use checkboxes to show progress on your roadmap.

- [] Feature 1
- [] Improve performance of X
- [] Add advanced documentation

## 🤝 Contributions

Explain how users can contribute to your library, typically:

Reporting bugs
Fixing bugs
Adding new features
Sharing on social media
Becoming an official contributor
Making a small donation

## 📜 License

Indicating the type of license for your project helps others know what they can and cannot do with it. You can find templates for all types of licenses here: <https://opensource.org/licenses>. Choose wisely, as this will determine how others can use your library.

In my case, I am developing open-source code and using the MIT license, which allows users to do almost anything with the code.

## 🙌 Footer

This is the closing section of your README. You can be creative here: introduce yourself, thank users for their interest, or ask them to give the project a star.
