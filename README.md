## 🔄 Development Workflow

This template is set up with a single branch workflow. This means that you will make changes directly in the `main` branch. This approach works best for small projects and solo developers:

1. Make changes directly in the `main` branch.
1. Use [conventional commit messages](https://gist.github.com/fvena/9e42792ad951b47ad143ba7e4bfedb5a).
1. Push changes to trigger the CI pipeline for linting and testing.

For larger projects or teams, consider adopting a feature-branch workflow with pull requests for better collaboration.

## 📦 Releasing a Version

1. Run the release script locally to bump the version and generate a changelog. The release script will:

   - Uses commit messages to determine the semantic version bump.
   - Generate a changelog.
   - Create a new git tag.
   - Pushes changes and tags to the remote repository.

   ```bash
   npm run release
   ```

1. The CI/CD pipeline will publish the new version to NPM and deploy updated documentation to GitHub Pages.

## 📖 Documentation

This template includes a preconfigured docs folder powered by VitePress. To start writing documentation:

1. Edit or add markdown files in the docs folder.
2. Start a local preview with:

   ```bash
   npm run docs:dev
   ```

## 🧩 FAQs

<details id="errors-when-publishing-the-package-to-npm">
  <summary><strong>Errors when publishing the package to npm</strong></summary>

- `npm ERR! code E403`: This error occurs when your email is not verified in npm or if the package name is already taken.

- `npm error code ENEEDAUTH`: This error occurs when the npm token is not set up correctly.

</details>

<details id="how-do-i-check-my-library-in-a-separate-project">
  <summary><strong>How do I check my library in a separate project?</strong></summary>

> This method is ideal for testing your library in a completely separate project environment.

- Link your library to the global npm environment:

  1. Run `npm link` command in your library's root directory.
  1. In the project where you want to use your library, run `npm link <your-library-name>`

- Unlink your library (optional):

  1. In the test project run `npm unlink <your-library-name>`.
  1. Run `npm unlink` in your library root.

- For more details, refer to the [npm link documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-link).

</details>

<details id="how-do-i-check-my-library-within-the-same-repository">
  <summary><strong>How do I check my library within the same repository?</strong></summary>

> This approach is useful for quickly testing your library without setting up a separate project.

- If you'd like to test your library directly within the same project, you can set up a local testing environment. Follow these steps:

  1. **Create a testing environment**: Inside your project root, create a playground folder for writing test code:

     ```bash
     mkdir playground
     ```

  1. **Initialize a local NPM project**: Navigate to the `playground` folder and set up an npm environment:

     ```bash
     cd playground
     npm init -y
     ```

  1. **Set the module type**: Update the `package.json` in `playground`folder to use ESM modules:

     ```json
     {
      ...
      "type": "module",
     }
     ```

  1. **Install TypeScript and Watcher**: Install TypeScript and `tsc-watch` as development dependencies to compile TypeScript files:

     ```bash
      npm install typescript tsc-watch --save-dev
     ```

  1. **Update Scripts**: Add the following scripts to the `package.json` file:

     ```json
     {
      ...
      "scripts": {
        "dev": "tsc-watch --noClear --onSuccess \"node ./dist/index.js\"",
        "build": "tsc"
      },
     }
     ```

  1. **Test your library**: Create a test file, such as `index.ts`, in the `playground` folderand import your library to run tests:

     ```typescript
     import { add } from "typescript-library-template-pro";

     console.log(add(1, 2));
     ```

  1. **Add a Eslint Configuration**: If you want to lint the playground code, create an `eslint.config.js` file in the `playground` directory and extend the library's configuration:

     ```typescript
     import config from "../../eslint.config.js";

     export default [...config];
     ```

  1. **Run the Playground**: Start the TypeScript watcher to compile the code and run the test file:

     ```bash
      npm run dev
     ```

<details id="how-do-i-adapt-the-library-for-browser-usage">
  <summary><strong>How do I adapt the library for browser usage?</strong></summary>

> By default, this template is optimized for Node.js, but it can be easily adapted for browser environments. Follow these steps:

1. **Update TypeScript Configuration**: Add browser-specific settings to your `tsconfig.json` file:

   ```json
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       "lib": ["ESNext", "DOM"],
       "target": "ESNext",
       "module": "ESNext",
       "moduleResolution": "node",
       "outDir": "./dist",
       "rootDir": "./src",
       "types": ["node"]
     }
   }

   ```json
   {
      "extends": "personal-style-guide/typescript/browser"
   }
   ```

1. **Configure EsLint**: If your library uses browser-specific APIs, update the ESLint configuration to include the browser environment:

   ```javascript
   import eslintBrowser from "personal-style-guide/eslint/browser";

   export default [...eslintBrowser];
   ```

1. **Configure Testing Environment**: If your library uses browser-specific APIs, set up `jsdom` as your testing environment:

   ```bash
    npm install jsdom --save-dev
   ```

   Then, configure Vitest to use `jsdom` in the `vitest.config.ts` file:

   ```typescript
   import { defineConfig } from "vitest/config";

   export default defineConfig({
     test: {
       environment: "jsdom",
       globals: true,
     },
   });
   ```

1. **Test in Browser Environment**: You can now test your library in a browser environment. For example, you can test the `localStorage` API:

   ```typescript
   test("localStorage works in browser environment", () => {
     localStorage.setItem("key", "value");
     expect(localStorage.getItem("key")).toBe("value");
   });
   ```

</details>

<details id="how-do-i-add-test-coverage">
  <summary><strong>How do I add test coverage?</strong></summary>

1. **Install `c8`**: Vitest uses c8 to generate coverage reports. Install it as a development dependency:

   ```bash
   npm i -D @vitest/coverage-v8
   ```

1. **Run Tests with Coverage**: To generate coverage reports, use the --coverage flag when running Vitest. Add the following script to your `package.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "test:coverage": "vitest run --coverage"
     }
   }
   ```

</details>

<details id="how-do-i-disable-documentation">
  <summary><strong>How do I disable documentation?</strong></summary>

- If you don't need documentation:

  1. Remove the `docs` folder and related `docs:*` scripts from `package.json`.
  1. Remove `vitepress` from the `devDependencies`.
  1. Delete the `buildDocs` and `deployDocs` jobs from the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file.

</details>

<details id="how-can-i-set-up-github-issue-templates">
  <summary><strong>How can I set up GitHub issue templates?</strong></summary>

- You can find a complete set of customizable templates and settings in this [GitHub gist](https://gist.github.com/fvena/2876b888b9f9375683a866dbb6c52886). It includes:
